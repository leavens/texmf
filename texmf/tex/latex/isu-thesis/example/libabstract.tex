Complete library abstract information goes here but cannot exceed
350 words in length and must be double-spaced.
This is the format of the abstract that must
be turned in by \textbf{all} students.  The pages are numbered separately
from the thesis.  The heading is centered and includes only the basic information
from the title page.
