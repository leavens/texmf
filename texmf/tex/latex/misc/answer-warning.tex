You are {\em not\/} under any circumstances to give these answers
to other students.  Giving these answers to another student makes
that student and you guilty of academic dishonesty.
Specifically it would make you guilty of tendering of information
and the other student guilty of obtaining unauthorized information,
misrepresentation, and plagiarism.
It also will not help the other student learn, and so may cause that
student to fail tests and the class.
