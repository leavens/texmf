<h1>README for tex-include LaTeX/BibTeX tree</h1>

<p>Last Revised on $Date$</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>
To use the LaTeX macros, styles and bibliography styles and databases,
you have to tell your TeX distribution about this tree.
</p>

<h3>Mac with TeX Live</h3>
<p>
On an Apple Macintosh I just put the root of this directory tree in <kbd>$HOME/Library</kbd> with the root named <kbd>texmf</kbd>, and the
it finds everything.</p>

<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>
This directory tree contains bibliography files, bibliography styles,
latex macros and styles designed by our research group (with some input from collaborators, especially for bibliography items).
</p>

<h3>Bibliography Support</h3>

<h4>Bibliography Databases</h4>

<p>In the directory <kbd>bibtex/bib/misc/</kbd>
there are several bibliography databases (<kbd>.bib</kbd> files).
The main ones are the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
 <code>Makefile</code>, which has as its default target the production
 of a file, <code>all.bib</code> (the concatenation of the .bib files
 below), which is useful in Framemaker and other such tools.
</li>
<li>
 <code>journal-abbrevs.bib</code>, which contains abbreviations for
 journal names; this is needed to use the other files.
</li>
<li>
 <code>datatypes.bib</code>, which has references on type theory,
 abstract data types, subtyping, types in programming languages
</li>
<li>
 <code>old-datatypes.bib</code>, which has 1970s and
 older references on datatypes, type theory, etc.
</li>
<li>
 <code>distrib.bib</code>, which has references on distributed and
 parallel processing, except language definitions.
</li>
<li>
 <code>languages.bib</code>, which has references on programming
 language issues, semantics, implementation, except types,
 distributed/parallel stuff, and aspect-oriented software development.
 All language definitions go here.
</li>
<li>
 <code>se.bib</code>, which has references on software engineering,
 specification, verification.
</li>
<li>
 <code>etc.bib</code>, which has references on math and general stuff
 that doesn't go elsewhere.
</li>
<li>
 <code>proceedings.bib</code>, which has various proceedings used by cross-reference in the other bib files.
</li>
</ul>

<H3>Bibtex Database Conventions</H3>
<P>
If you change the bibtex database files, don't change <code>all.bib</code> as
that is automatically generated.  Please instead change one of the
other files that is used to create it (see the Makefile).
<P>
If you change add or change these bibliography files, please also
follow our conventions.  The main ones are as follows. 
<ul>
<li>Categorize the contribution into the appropriate bibliography file
as best you can.
<li>For citation keys, use the full names of up to 3 authors,
separated by hyphens, followed by the last two digits of the year.
For example, <code>Leavens-Baker-Ruby02</code>.  For more authors, use
<code>-etal</code> after the first author's name, followed by the last
two digits of the year.
<li>If you have physically laid hands on the paper, then put in an
<code>Annote</code> key the number of references, e.g.,
<code>Annote="23 references."</code>.  You can have more text in the
annote entry, but put the number of references last.  If there are
hundreds of references, then just say something like
<code>Annote="Hundreds of references."</code> instead of counting
them.
<li>
Use single letters after the year if the same group of authors has more
than one paper in the given year.  For example, 
<code>Clifton-Leavens02a</code>.
<li>
Keep the bibliography files sorted.
<li>
Use 3 letter abbreviations of months, without quotes or brackets, for example
<code>nov</code> or <code>may</code>.  These are
bibtex macros which are expanded or contracted by the style sheet; if
you quote or bracket them they aren't macros anymore.
<li>
Don't put quote marks or brackets around numbers for years, and only
put in quote marks or brackets around other numbers if needed.
</ul>

<P>If a paper's entry gets replaced by a better version, it's probably safest
to make a new entry.  However, for one of our own papers, it would be
more usual to replace the entry with an entry for the published
version, and to rename the technical report version.  For example,
change the technical report entry of 
<code>Clifton-Leavens02</code>
to have the key <code>Clifton-Leavens02a</code>
when the publication appears, and put the publication under the key
<code>Clifton-Leavens02</code>.

<p>
If you make an entry for a paper with Leavens as a coauthor, please
also place a copy of the entry in the file <code>leavens.bib</code>.
You are welcome to make your own personal bibliography file also.


<h3>LaTeX Styles</h3>
<p>
There are also many latex macro and style files in the directory <kbd>tex/latex/misc/</kbd>.
All are unsupported, so use at your own risk.
</p>

<h4>Conventions for the Latex Macro Files</h4>
<p>
If you channge the latex macro files, please make any changes upward
compatible, so that old papers still can be formatted.  The easiest
way is to always use new names.  Usually we use upper case for macro names.
