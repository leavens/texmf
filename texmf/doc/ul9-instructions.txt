To install the Luximono font:

On a mac, it seems to work to just do the following magic command

  sudo getnonfreefonts-sys --all --force

which installs this and many other fonts.

On a Windows machine with Miktex, it works out of the box.
However, to use this directory structure here, requires you to add
this texmf directory structure to MikTeX as a new root, using the
MikTeX settings program (which is miktex/miktex/bin/x64/mo.exe on a
Windows 8 machinee).

On cygwin with tetex you should download the extra fonts that cygwin provides.
Then you need to add the following lines to the (end of)
/usr/share/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg:

  # Luximono
  Map ul9.map

I think then you just rebuild the systems files (use texhash) and it
works.
