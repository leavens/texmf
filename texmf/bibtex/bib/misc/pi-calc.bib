   abstract = {$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe property of a (formal) development method which gives the
   development process the potential for productivity is
   compositionality.  Interference is what makes it difficult to find
   compositional development methods for concurrent systems.  This
   paper is intended to contribute to tractable development methods for
   concurrent programs.  In particular it explores ways in which
   object-based language concepts can be used to provide a
   compositional development method for concurrent programs.  This text
   summarizes results from three draft papers.  It firstly shows how
   object-based concepts can be used to provide a designer with control
   over interference and proposes a transformational style of
   development (for systems with limited interference) in which
   concurrency is introduced only in the final stages of design.  The
   essential idea here is to show that certain object graphs limit
   interference.  Secondly, the paper shows how a suitable logic can be
   used to reason about those systems where interference plays an
   essential role.  Here again, concepts are used in the design
   notation which are taken from object-oriented languages since they
   offer control of granularity and way of pinpointing interference.
   Thirdly, the paper outlines the semantics of the design notation
   mapping its constructs to Milner's $\backslash$pic.}

   abstract = {$\backslash$n$\backslash$nEarlier papers give examples of the development of concurrent

   assertions over such graphs to reason about about interference.
   This report merges (and corrects minor inconsistencies between) two
   papers which document the semantics of $\backslash$pobl\ by providing a mapping
   to the $\backslash$pic\ and indicate how arguments about the design notation
   might be based on that semantics.  It also reflects some recent work

   suffered from the lack of any generally accepted formal foundations for
   defining their semantics.  Furthermore, the delicate relationship
   between object-oriented features supporting reuse and operational
   features concerning interaction and state change is poorly understood
   in a concurrent setting.  To address this problem, we propose the
   development of an object calculus, borrowing heavily from relevant work
   in the area of process calculi.  To this end, we briefly review some of
   this work, we pose some informal requirements for an object calculus,
   and we present the syntax, operational semantics and use through
   examples of a proposed object calculus, called OC.}
