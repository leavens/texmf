                  templates for parameter subclasses that are

                  program. Parameters can be functions, e.g. equal for
                  set elements, but are usually categories. A category
                  is a class whose instances encapsulate the
                  operations of some view of a set of
                  objects. Categories form a repository for generic
                  methods. There can be many views of the same
                  domain. One can also form views from other
                  categories. Optional methods can be attached to a
                  category for efficiency; if an optional method isn't
                  supplied, a generic method is used in its
                  place. Categories form a multigraph. Categories that

                  be based on the class of more than one argument. The

                  analysis, and a block whose body is illegally typed
                  has a legal type. Case analysis might be
                  exponential. Some type inference is done, but in
                  general declarations are required. The perform
                  method and the new primitive are not type

                  abstractions and their concrete implementations,
                  allowing representations to be changed
                  easily. Non-symmetric type compatibility used for
                  refinement of types and procedures is based on

                  is, (indefinite) objects can be used as types, but

                  variables creates a dependency; accessing instance
                  variables only via operations is prefered. Hiding
                  instance variables from subclasses implies merging
                  inherited instance variables is wrong. The use of
                  inheritance itself should be hidden; this allows

                  technique and permits one to exclude operations in a
                  subclass. Inheritance should only allow access to
                  the class interface of immediate parent classes, not
                  more distant ancestors. Subtyping should be
                  separated from inheritance and based on the external

                  1. provide a flexible base for users to define their
                  own windows, 2. to provide canned windows for
                  generic uses, 3. control the underlying complexity
                  by defaults and 4. provide some control and
                  uniformity over what the user can do. Coupling and
                  abstraction seem to be minor concerns. Defaults and
                  options seem as important as flavors for flexibility
                  and mastering complexity. Ease of flavor combination
                  important for flexibility and convenience. Multiple
                  representations and implementations not important,
                  rather different combinations of various
                  features. Multiple inheritance allows basic flavors
                  that are orthogonal and thus small and easily
                  reused. Orthogonality of flavors is important
                  because the mechanism does not allow methods to be
                  omitted from an included flavor. Implicit is user's
                  ability to define new flavors and override anything
                  not desired. Not everything is a flavor instance,
                  thus elaborate conventions for ad hoc polymorphism

                  objects back to list placeholders, so more
                  indirectness is required, and in particular one
                  cannot go from one list to the next through an
                  element. Backward pointers cannot be used without
                  exposing the rep. How can pointers be put in user
                  data structures and still controlled? Abstract list
                  elements instead of lists. But this solution
                  involves allowing abstract types to live in
                  different parts of the same record, namely
                  extensible records. This allows the list element
                  abstraction to point at the whole of a list element

                  abstraction. Generics allow code savings and ability

                  confinement types presented earlier by Grothoff et
                  al. Confinement types ensure that no instance of a
                  confined type may escaped the code of the package in
                  which the instance's class is declared. This is
                  coarser-grained than ownership types, but is more
                  lightweight and offers some similar benefits. The
                  paper presents a core calculus and sound type system
                  for Confined Featherweight Java. The paper then
                  extends this type system to handle generic types and
                  "post-hoc confined", where generic types
                  instantiated with confined types for the type
                  parameters become themselves confined. A core
                  calculus and sound type system for Confined Generic
                  Featherweight Java is presented. The key ideas in
                  the paper are very interesting. The paper does
                  suffer from many grammatical errors and a few key
                  errors in the formalism make me a bit
                  suspicious. All the errors I saw were typographical,
                  but the lack of attention to detail in a formal
                  paper was a bit troublesome. However, my intuition
                  says that the system is sound as they claim.},
