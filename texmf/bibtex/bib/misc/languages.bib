                  extreme resource constraints. At the same time these
                  systems are very complex and many concerns in the
                  implementation of such systems are of highly
                  crosscutting nature. The concept of aspect
                  orientation can be applied to allow a modular
                  implementation of these concerns. With AspectJ the
                  first complete and powerful language extension for
                  aspect-oriented programming (AOP) has been
                  created. However, the costs of the Java run-time
                  environment are not feasible for most embedded
                  applications.This paper presents AspectC++ (Gal &
                  Spinczyk 2001), a new language extension to C/C++
                  that provides powerful language elements to
                  facilitate aspect-oriented programming even in
                  domains with tight resource limitations. }
