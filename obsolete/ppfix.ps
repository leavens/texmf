% Here is a quick hack to print documents created for one
% paper size on another.  Note that if the sizes are not
% very close graphics will be distorted.
%
% Just add this as a prefix to your document.
% (To retain pagination control, it should come AFTER the
% %%EndComments line, preferably in the %%BeginSetup section.)

% The following is only needed if the software producing the PS
% output is nasty and uses machine dependent stuff (essentially,
% setpagedevice).  No guarantee that this won't cause you trouble!
% If any of this cause the code to break, try commenting out the
% stuff below.  On the other hand, if the rescaling has no effect
% you might need to add another similar line for some paper size I
% overlooked.
% NOTE: if you get an "invalidaccess" command from one of the def's
%  below (because the dict is not writable), try removing the
%  begin-end pairs around the def's and adding a 'pop' (see the
%  redefinition of /setpagedevice for an example).

%/setpagedevice where { pop /setpagedevice {pop} def } if
%/letter where { begin /letter{}def end} if
%/lettersmall where { begin /lettersmall{}def end} if
%/legal where { begin /legal{}def end} if
%/ledger where { begin /ledger{}def end} if
%/11x17 where { begin /11x17{}def end} if
%/a4 where { begin /a4{}def end} if
%/a4small where { begin /a4small{}def end} if
%/a3 where { begin /a3{}def end} if
