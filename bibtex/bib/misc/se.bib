This allows very fine grained specification, and static typechecking, of the aliasing relationships in a program.  The system replaces the traditional owners-as-dominators property of ownership type systems with a link soundness property.  The link soundness property says that the only inter-domain aliases are those between domains which are explicitly given permission to hold such aliases.  The authors' ownership domains are significantly more fine-grained than my concern domains, with each object (not class) having its own member domains.

 Their related work section is a nice, concise summary of work on alias control in Java.

  abstract =	 "We introduce a simple programming language and
                  define its predicate transformer semantics. We
                  motivate the choice of the constructs for the
                  language by algebra ic arguments, showing that the
                  constructs are essentially the basic algebraic op
                  erations that are available for predicate
                  transformers, when these are viewed as forming a
                  complete lattice enriched category. We then show
                  that the statements in the language can be given a
                  simple operational interpretation, as describing the
                  interaction between a user and a computing
                  system. This gives a general intuitive
                  interpretation of angelic and demonic
                  nondeterminism. We also consider the notion of
                  correctness and refinement of program statements
                  that this intuitive interpretation gives rise to,
                  and show the connection between the user-system
                  interpretation and the interpretation of program
                  execution as a game."

Both separation logic and region logic are successful approaches to framing, with separation logic providing a concise way to reason about data structures that are disjoint, and region logic providing the ability to reason about framing for shared mutable data. In order to obtain the benefits of both logics for programs with shared mutable data, this paper unifies them into a single logic, which can encode both of them and allows them to interoperate. The new logic thus provides a way to reason about program modules specified in a mix of styles.},

abstract="Model checking is an established technique for automatically verifying that a model satisfies a given temporal property. When the model violates the property, the model checker returns a counterexample, which is a sequence of actions leading to a state where the property is not satisfied. Understanding this counterexample for debugging the specification is a complicated task for several reasons: (i) the counterexample can contain hundreds of actions, (ii) the debugging task is mostly achieved manually, and (iii) the counterexample does not give any clue on the state of the system (e.g., parallelism or data expressions) when the error occurs. This paper presents a new approach that improves the usability of model checking by simplifying the comprehension of counterexamples. Our solution aims at keeping only actions in counterexamples that are relevant for debugging purposes. To do so, we first extract in the model all the counterexamples. Second, we define an analysis algorithm that identifies actions that make the behaviour skip from incorrect to correct behaviours, making these actions relevant from a debugging perspective. Our approach is fully automated by a tool that we implemented and applied on real-world case studies from various application areas for evaluation purposes.",

abstract="Automatic white-box testing based on formal methods is now a relatively mature technology and operational tools are available. Despite this, and the cost of manual testing, the technology is still rarely applied in an industrial setting. This paper describes how the specific needs of the user can be taken into account in order to build the necessary interface with a generic test tool. We present PathCrawler/LTest, a generator of test inputs for structural coverage of C functions, recently extended to support labels. Labels offer a generic mechanism for specification of code coverage criteria and make it possible to prototype and implement new criteria for specific industrial needs. We describe the essential participation of the research branch of an industrial user in bridging the gap between the tool developers and their business unit and adapting PathCrawler/LTest to the needs of the latter. We present the excellent results so far of their ongoing adoption and finish by mentioning possible improvements.",

abstract="The research community made enormous progress in the past years in developing algorithms for verifying software, as shown by international competitions. Unfortunately, the transfer into industrial practice is slow. A reason for this might be that the verification tools do not connect well to the developer work-flow. This paper presents a solution to this problem: We use verification witnesses as interface between verification tools and the testing process that every developer is familiar with. Many modern verification tools report, in case a bug is found, an error path as exchangeable verification witness. Our approach is to synthesize a test from each witness, such that the developer can inspect the verification result using familiar technology, such as debuggers, profilers, and visualization tools. Moreover, this approach identifies the witnesses as an interface between formal verification and testing: Developers can use arbitrary (witness-producing) verification tools, and arbitrary converters from witnesses to tests; we implemented two such converters. We performed a large experimental study to confirm that our proposed solution works well in practice: Out of 18Â 966Â verification results obtained fromÂ 21 verifiers, 14Â 727Â results were confirmed by witness-based result validation, and 10Â 080Â of these results were confirmed alone by extracting and executing tests, meaning that the desired specification violation was effectively observed. We thus show that our approach is directly and immediately applicable to verification results produced by software verifiers that adhere to the international standard for verification witnesses.",

Coverage criteria and coverage measurements are used to ensure that the constructed test suites adequately test the given software. Since manually developing such test suites is too expensive in practice, various automatic test-generation approaches were proposed. Since all approaches come with different strengths, combinations are necessary in order to achieve stronger tools. We study cooperative combinations of verification approaches for test generation, with high-level information exchange.",

Nitpick supports unbounded quantification, (co)inductive predicates and datatypes, and (co)recursive functions. Fundamentally a finite model finder, it approximates infinite types by finite subsets. As case studies, we consider a security type system and a hotel key card system. Our experimental results on Isabelle theories and the TPTP library indicate that Nitpick generates more counterexamples than other model finders for higher-order logic, without restrictions on the form of the formulas to falsify.",

The tool supports both generic multithreaded and vector-based programming models. In particular, it can verify multithreaded programs written in Java, specified with JML extended with separation logic. It can also verify parallelizable programs written in a toy language that supports the characteristic features of OpenCL. The tool verifies programs by first encoding the specified program into a much simpler programming language and then applying the Chalice verifier to the simplified program. In this paper we discuss both the implementation of the tool and the features of its specification language.",

abstract = {Symbolic analysis shows promise as a foundation for bug-finding, specification inference, verification, and test generation. This paper addresses demand-driven symbolic analysis for object-oriented programs and frameworks. Many such codes comprise large, partial programs with highly dynamic behaviors--polymorphism, reflection, and so on--posing significant scalability challenges for any static analysis.We present an approach based on interprocedural backwards propagation of weakest preconditions. We present several novel techniques to improve the efficiency of such analysis. First, we present directed call graph construction, where call graph construction and symbolic analysis are interleaved. With this technique, call graph construction is guided by constraints discovered during symbolic analysis, obviating the need for exhaustively exploring a large, conservative call graph. Second, we describe generalization, a technique that greatly increases the reusability of procedure summaries computed during interprocedural analysis. Instead of tabulating how a procedure transforms a symbolic state in its entirety, our technique tabulates how the procedure transforms only the pertinent portion of the symbolic state. Additionally, we show how integrating an inexpensive, custom logic simplifier with weakest precondition computation dramatically improves performance.We have implemented the analysis in a tool called Snugglebug and evaluated it as a bug-report feasibility checker. Our results show that the algorithmic techniques were critical for successfully analyzing large Java applications.},

abstract = {We consider the classical problem of invariant generation for programs with polynomial
assignments and focus on synthesizing invariants that are a conjunction of strict
polynomial inequalities. We present a sound and semi-complete method based on positivstellensaetze,
i.e. theorems in semi-algebraic geometry that characterize positive polynomials over
a semi-algebraic set. On the theoretical side, the worst-case complexity of our approach
is subexponential, whereas the worst-case complexity of the previous complete method
(Kapur, ACA 2004) is doubly-exponential. Even when restricted to linear invariants,
the best previous complexity for complete invariant generation is exponential (Colon
et al, CAV 2003). On the practical side, we reduce the invariant generation problem
to quadratic programming (QCLP), which is a classical optimization problem with many
industrial solvers. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by providing
experimental results on several academic benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge,
the only previous invariant generation method that provides completeness guarantees
for invariants consisting of polynomial inequalities is (Kapur, ACA 2004), which relies
on quantifier elimination and cannot even handle toy programs such as our running
example.},

We found that the application under study used a small set of functional programming idioms; methods using these idioms could be verified by techniques that used only first-order logic and did not need all the features that might be required for full generality of functional programming.",

General functional programming requires reasoning about how the specifications of function objects that are inputs to a method combine to produce the specifications of output function objects. This short paper describes our in-progress experience in adapting prior work (Kassios & M\"{u}ller) to Java 8, JML, OpenJML, and to ACSL++, a specification language for C++ built on ACSL.},

verification tool must evolve with it. Changes in Java since Java 8 bring language
and organizational changes which affect the semantics of JML and the implementation
of OpenJML. They also raise questions about language definition, joint efforts, and
community engagement, some enumerated in this paper, for the Java formal reasoning
community to address.},

Harmless advice may affect the control flow of a program and may perform I/O, but it may not change the data of the base program (excepting through I/O).  The paper uses the basic technique of \citet{Walker-Zdancewic-Ligatti03}, but does not allow data exchange.  More specifically, the system allows data to flow from high protection domains to lower protection domains, but not vice versa.  The protection domains are part of the type system and form a lattice order.  The paper gives a proof of a weak non-interference property.

Following \citet{Walker-Zdancewic-Ligatti03}, they give a simple object-oriented language that can be translated to the core language in a type-preserving way.}

abstract = {This paper presents a new method for generating inductive loop invariants that are
expressible as boolean combinations of linear integer constraints. The key idea underlying
our technique is to perform a backtracking search that combines Hoare-style verification
condition generation with a logical abduction procedure based on quantifier elimination
to speculate candidate invariants. Starting with true, our method iteratively strengthens
loop invariants until they are inductive and strong enough to verify the program.
A key feature of our technique is that it is lazy: It only infers those invariants
that are necessary for verifying program correctness. Furthermore, our technique can
infer arbitrary boolean combinations (including disjunctions) of linear invariants.
We have implemented the proposed approach in a tool called HOLA. Our experiments demonstrate
that HOLA can infer interesting invariants that are beyond the reach of existing state-of-the-art
invariant generation tools.},

abstract = {In the past decade, research on test-suite-based automatic program repair has grown significantly. Each year, new approaches and implementations are featured in major software engineering venues. However, most of those approaches are evaluated on a single benchmark of bugs, which are also rarely reproduced by other researchers. In this paper, we present a large-scale experiment using 11 Java test-suite-based repair tools and 2,141 bugs from 5 benchmarks. Our goal is to have a better understanding of the current state of automatic program repair tools on a large diversity of benchmarks. Our investigation is guided by the hypothesis that the repairability of repair tools might not be generalized across different benchmarks. We found that the 11 tools 1) are able to generate patches for 21\% of the bugs from the 5 benchmarks, and 2) have better performance on Defects4J compared to other benchmarks, by generating patches for 47\% of the bugs from Defects4J compared to 10-30\% of bugs from the other benchmarks. Our experiment comprises 23,551 repair attempts, which we used to find causes of non-patch generation. These causes are reported in this paper, which can help repair tool designers to improve their approaches and tools.},

abstract = {To find defects in software, one needs test cases that execute the software systematically, and oracles that assess the correctness of the observed behavior when running these test cases. This paper presents EvoSuite, a tool that automatically generates test cases with assertions for classes written in Java code. To achieve this, EvoSuite applies a novel hybrid approach that generates and optimizes whole test suites towards satisfying a coverage criterion. For the produced test suites, EvoSuite suggests possible oracles by adding small and effective sets of assertions that concisely summarize the current behavior; these assertions allow the developer to detect deviations from expected behavior, and to capture the current behavior in order to protect against future defects breaking this behavior.},

The generator accepts a program written in a subset of C, finds loops in it, analyses the loops, generates and outputs invariants. It also uses a special consequence removal mode added to Vampire to remove invariants implied by other invariants. The generator is implemented as a standalone tool, thus no knowledge of theorem proving is required from its users.",

                  adjunction between categories of deterministic
                  automata and their behaviours. Our first step is to
                  redefine (morphisms in) these categories of automata
                  and behaviours so that a restriction in Goguen's
                  approach can be avoided. Subsequently we give a
                  coalgebraic analysis of this behaviour-realization
                  adjunction; it yields a second generalization to
                  other types of (not only deterministic) automata
                  (and their behaviours). We further show that our
                  (redefined) categories of automata and behaviours
                  support elementary process combinators like
                  renaming, restriction, parallel composition,
                  replication and feedback (some of which also occur,
                  for example, in the $\pi$-calculus). One of the main
                  contributions is that replication $!P$ is defined
                  for an automaton $P$ such that $!P$ is the terminal
                  coalgebra $!P \stackrel{\cong}{\rightarrow} P \| !P$
                  of the functor $P \| (-)$ ``compose with $P$''. The
                  behaviour functor from automata to their behaviours
                  preserves these process combinators, so that the
                  behaviour of a complex automaton can be understood
                  from the behaviour of its components.",

                  in object-oriented programming is elaborated:
                  objects consist of a (unique) identifier, a local
                  state, and a collection of methods described as a
                  coalgebra; classes are coalgebraic (behavioural)
                  specifications of objects. The creation of a ``new''
                  object of a class is described in terms of the
                  terminal coalgebra satisfying the specification. We
                  present a notion of ``totally specified'' class,
                  which leads to particularly simple terminal
                  coalgebras. We further describe local and global
                  operational semantics for objects. Associated with
                  the local operational semantics is a notion of
                  bisimulation (for objects belonging to the same
                  class), expressing observational
                  indistinguishability."

abstract="Contract-based design (CBD) is an emerging paradigm for complex systems, specifying the input-output behavior of a component by defining what the component guarantees, provided its environment satisfies the given assumptions. Under certain circumstances, it is possible to verify the decomposition of contracts to conclude the correctness of the top-level system requirements. Verification is performed by using model checkers. If the decomposition of the contract is found to be incorrect, a model checker generates a counterexample. However, the challenging task is to understand the counterexample, which usually is lengthy, cryptic, and verbose. In this paper, we propose an approach to derive an understandable error explanation for counterexamples in CBD. In addition, we highlight the erroneous variables and erroneous states in the counterexample, which reduces the effort to identify errors. Therefore, our approach supports error comprehension of the original counterexample. Our approach is evaluated based on two industrial use cases, the Bosch Electronic Power Steering (EPS) and a redundant sensor system.",

                  is evaluated at the design level and extensions to
                  UML are presented that allow the modeling of
                  aspects, sub-aspects, and their
                  interaction. Translating these models into actual
                  code is left as future work.},

abstract = {The Java Modeling Language (JML) is a language for specifying the behavior of Java
source code. However, it can describe the protocols of Java classes and interfaces
only implicitly. Typestate protocol specification is a more direct, lightweight and
abstract way of documenting usage protocols for object-oriented programs. In this
paper, we propose a technique for incorporating the typestate concept into JML for
specifying protocols of Java classes and interfaces, based on our previous research
on typestate protocol specifications [4]. This paper presents a set of formal translation
rules for encoding typestate protocol specifications into pre/post-condition specifications.
It shows how typestate protocol specifications can be mixed with pre/post-condition
specifications and how violations of code contracts in inheritance can be handled.
Finally, our proposed technique is demonstrated within the Java/JML environment to
show its effectiveness.},

abstract = {This paper presents a technique for translating common comprehension expressions (sum,
count, product, min, and max) into verification conditions that can be tackled by
two off-the-shelf first-order SMT solvers. Since a first-order SMT solver does not
directly support the bound variables that occur in comprehension expressions, the
challenge is to provide a sound axiomatisation that is strong enough to prove interesting
programs and, furthermore, that can be used automatically by the SMT solver. The technique
has been implemented in the Spec# program verifier. The paper also reports on the
experience of using Spec# to verify several challenging programming examples drawn
from a textbook by Dijkstra and Feijen.},

abstract = {Automated Program Repair (APR) has attracted significant attention from software engineering research and practice communities in the last decade. Several teams have recorded promising performance in fixing real bugs and there is a race in the literature to fix as many bugs as possible from established benchmarks. Gradually, repair performance of APR tools in the literature has gone from being evaluated with a metric on the number of generated plausible patches to the number of correct patches. This evolution is necessary after a study highlighting the overfitting issue in test suite-based automatic patch generation. Simultaneously, some researchers are also insisting on providing time cost in the repair scenario as a metric for comparing state-of-the-art systems. In this paper, we discuss how the latest evaluation metrics of APR systems could be biased. Since design decisions (both in approach and evaluation setup) are not always fully disclosed, the impact on repair performance is unknown and computed metrics are often misleading. To reduce notable biases of design decisions in program repair approaches, we conduct a critical review on the evaluation of patch generation systems and propose eight evaluation metrics for fairly assessing the performance of APR tools. Eventually, we show with experimental data on 11 baseline program repair systems that the proposed metrics allow to highlight some caveats in the literature. We expect wide adoption of these metrics in the community to contribute to boosting the development of practical, and reliably performable program repair tools.}

abstract = {We can specify design constraints of a software system using a formal language such as Object Constraint Language (OCL). However, OCL is not executable and cannot be explicitly used as a testing method. So runtime constraint checking is needed to mitigate this problem. Checking design constraints at runtime can help to detect design drift. On the other hand, making a software testable is also hard since testing requires active involvement of programmers. Testable software introduces a quality characteristics of software artifact called testability. This paper mainly concentrates on improving observability, one of the major factors that determine testability of a software artifact. To avoid design drift and make software more testable, this paper proposes an aspect-oriented testability framework for object oriented software testing, which enables runtime constraint checking against implementation code and improves the testability of a software system. This framework completely takes the advantage of aspect-oriented programming (AOP) approaches and is totally modular and plug-and-playable.},

abstract="Software is widely used in critical systems. Thus, it is important that developers can quickly find semantic bugs with testing; however, semantic bugs can only be revealed by tests that use valid inputs. Guided fuzzers can create input tests that cover all branches; however, they may not necessarily cover all branches with valid inputs. Therefore, the problem is how to guide a fuzzer to cover all branches in a program with only valid inputs. We perform a study of an idea that guarantees that all inputs generated by a guided fuzzer that reach the program under test are valid using formal specifications and runtime assertion checking. Our results show that this idea improves the feedback given to a guided fuzzer.",

                  release of a large telephone switching system. The
                  following factors helped modifiability: prepared

                  through data for some functions, general modules for

                  multiple modules, or with multiple alternate
                  implementations, features spread among several
                  modules, implementation of decisions in wrong

abstract="An ongoing challenge for computer science is the development of a tool which automatically verifies programs meet their specifications, and are free from runtime errors such as divide-by-zero, array out-of-bounds and null dereferences. Several impressive systems have been developed to this end, such as ESC/Java and Spec{\#}, which build on existing programming languages (e.g. Java, C{\#}). However, there remains a need for an open research platform in this area. We have developed the Whiley programming language, and its accompanying verifying compiler, as an open platform for research. Whiley has been designed from the ground up to simplify the verification process. In this paper, we introduce the Whiley language and it accompanying verifying compiler tool.",

abstract="Purity Analysis is the problem of determining whether or not a method may have side-effects. This has applications in automatic parallelisation, extended static checking, and more. We present a novel purity system for Java that employs purity annotations which can be checked modularly. This is done using a flow-sensitive, intraprocedural analysis. The system exploits two properties, called freshness and locality, to increase the range of methods that can be considered pure. JPure also includes an inference engine for annotating legacy code. We evaluate our system against several packages from the Java Standard Library. Our results indicate it is possible to uncover significant amounts of purity efficiently.",

                  tools that are knowledgeable about the process of

                  symbiosis with the system builders and

abstract = { T3i is an automated unit-testing tool to test Java classes. To expose interactions T3i generates test-cases in the form of sequences of calls to the methods of the target class. What separates it from other testing tools is that it treats test suites as first class objects and allows users to e.g. combine, query, and filter them. With these operations, the user can construct a test suite with specific properties. Queries can be used to check correctness properties. Hoare triples, LTL formulas, and algebraic equations can be queried. T3i can be used interactively, thus facilitating more exploratory testing, as well as through a script. The familiar Java syntax can be used to control it, or alternatively one can use the much lighter Groovy syntax. },

  abstract =	 "Embedded assertions have long been recognized as a
                  potentially powerful tool for automatic runtime
                  detection of software faults during debugging,
                  testing and maintenance. However, they have seen
                  little widespread use in practice because previous
                  assertion processing tools did not integrate easily
                  with existing programming environments, and it is
                  not well understood what kinds of assertions are
                  most effective at detecting software faults. The
                  author describes experience using an assertion
                  processing tool that was built to address the
                  concerns of ease-of-use and effectiveness. The tool
                  is called APP, an Annotation Pre-Processor for C
                  programs developed in UNIX-based development
                  environments. APP has been used to develop a number
                  of software systems over three years. Based on this
                  experience, the author presents a classification of
                  the assertions that were most effective at detecting
                  faults. While the assertions that are described
                  guard against many common kinds of faults and
                  errors, the very commonness of such faults
                  demonstrates the need for an explicit, high-level,
                  automatically checkable specification of required
                  behavior.",

abstract = {We present a new technique for the generation of non-linear (algebraic) invariants
of a program. Our technique uses the theory of ideals over polynomial rings to reduce
the non-linear invariant generation problem to a numerical constraint solving problem.
So far, the literature on invariant generation has been focussed on the construction
of linear invariants for linear programs. Consequently, there has been little progress
toward non-linear invariant generation. In this paper, we demonstrate a technique
that encodes the conditions for a given template assertion being an invariant into
a set of constraints, such that all the solutions to these constraints correspond
to non-linear (algebraic) loop invariants of the program. We discuss some trade-offs
between the completeness of the technique and the tractability of the constraint-solving
problem generated. The application of the technique is demonstrated on a few examples.},

(d.f.a.) as model checking: By employing abstract interpretation (a.i.) to generate
program traces and by utilizing Kozen's modal mu-calculus to express trace properties,
we express in simplest possible terms that a d.f.a. is a model check of a program's
a.i. trace. In particular, the classic flow equations for bit-vector-based d.f.a.s
reformat trivially into modal mu-Calculus formulas. A surprising consequence is that
two of the classical d.f.a.s are exposed as unsound; this problem is analyzed and
simply repaired. In the process of making the above discoveries, we clarify the relationship
between a.i. and d.f.a. in terms of the often-misunderstood notion of collecting semantics
and we highlight how the research areas of flow analysis, abstract interpretation,
and model checking have grown together.},

abstract = {We present a novel static analysis technique that substantially improves the quality
of invariants inferred by standard loop invariant generation techniques. Our technique
decomposes multi-phase loops, which require disjunctive invariants, into a semantically
equivalent sequence of single-phase loops, each of which requires simple, conjunctive
invariants. We define splitter predicates which are used to identify phase transitions
in loops, and we present an algorithm to find useful splitter predicates that enable
the phase-reducing transformation. We show experimentally on a set of representative
benchmarks from the literature and real code examples that our technique substantially
increases the quality of invariants inferred by standard invariant generation techniques.
Our technique is conceptually simple, easy to implement, and can be integrated into
any automatic loop invariant generator.},

abstract = { Automated program repair has shown promise for reducing the significant manual effort debugging requires. This paper addresses a deficit of earlier evaluations of automated repair techniques caused by repairing programs and evaluating generated patches' correctness using the same set of tests. Since tests are an imperfect metric of program correctness, evaluations of this type do not discriminate between correct patches and patches that overfit the available tests and break untested but desired functionality. This paper evaluates two well-studied repair tools, GenProg and TrpAutoRepair, on a publicly available benchmark of bugs, each with a human-written patch. By evaluating patches using tests independent from those used during repair, we find that the tools are unlikely to improve the proportion of independent tests passed, and that the quality of the patches is proportional to the coverage of the test suite used during repair. For programs that pass most tests, the tools are as likely to break tests as to fix them. However, novice developers also overfit, and automated repair performs no worse than these developers. In addition to overfitting, we measure the effects of test suite coverage, test suite provenance, and starting program quality, as well as the difference in quality between novice-developer-written and tool-generated patches when quality is assessed with a test suite independent from the one used for patch generation. },

@article{Svendsen-Birkedal-Parkinson10,
Abstract = {Recently, object-oriented languages, such as C ]> , have been extended with language features prevalent in most functional languages: parametric polymorphism and higher-order functions. In the OO world these are called generics and delegates, respectively. These features allow for greater code reuse and reduce the possibilities for runtime errors. However, the combination of these features pushes the language beyond current object-oriented verification techniques. In this paper, we address this by extending a higher-order separation logic with new assertions for reasoning about delegates and variables. We faithfully capture the semantics of C ]> delegates including their capture of the l-value of a variable, and that ˵stack″ variables can live beyond their ˵scope″. We demonstrate that our logic is sound and illustrate its use by specifying and verifying a series of interesting and challenging examples. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

                  normalizer. Equations for faithful functions can be
                  used regardless of the laws. If associated function
                  is not faithful, can sometimes find a faithful
                  representing function to reason with. 10

abstract="Although the counterexample returned by a model checker can help in reproducing the symptom related to a defect, a significant amount of effort is often required for the programmer to interpret it in order to locate the cause. In this paper, we provide an automated procedure to zoom in to potential software defects by analyzing a single concrete counterexample. Our analysis relies on extracting from the counterexample a syntactic-level proof of infeasibility, i.e., a minimal set of word-level predicates that contradict with each other. The procedure uses an efficient weakest pre-condition algorithm carried out on a single concrete execution path, which is significantly more scalable than other model checking based approaches. Unlike most of the existing methods, we do not need additional execution traces other than the buggy one. We use public-domain examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our new algorithm.",

The AutoFix-E tool automatically generates and validates fixes for software faults. The key insights behind AutoFix-E are to rely on contracts present in the software to ensure that the proposed fixes are semantically sound, and on state diagrams using an abstract notion of state based on the boolean queries of a class. Out of 42 faults found by an automatic testing tool in two widely used Eiffel libraries, AutoFix-E proposes successful fixes for 16 faults. Submitting some of these faults to experts shows that several of the proposed fixes are identical or close to fixes proposed by humans.},

abstract = {Closures are a language feature supported by many mainstream languages, combining
the ability to package up references to code blocks with the possibility of capturing
state from the environment of the closure's declaration. Closures are powerful, but
complicate understanding and formal reasoning, especially when closure invocations
may mutate objects reachable from the captured state or from closure arguments. This
paper presents a novel technique for the modular specification and verification of
closure-manipulating code in Rust. Our technique combines Rust's type system guarantees
and novel specification features to enable formal verification of rich functional
properties. It encodes higher-order concerns into a first-order logic, which enables
automation via SMT solvers. Our technique is implemented as an extension of the deductive
verifier Prusti, with which we have successfully verified many common idioms of closure
usage.},

abstract = {Providing a pair of pre and post-condition for a method or a procedure is a typical
way of program specification. When specifying a post-condition, it is often necessary
to compare the post-state value of a variable with its pre-state value. To access
a pre-sate value at a post-condition, most contract languages such as Eiffel and JML
provide an old expression; old(x) returns a pre-state value of variable x. However,
old expressions pose several problems, most notably the lack of encapsulation; old(x)
does not encapsulate an object graph rooted from the pre-state value of x. Thus, method-call
expressions like x.equals(old(x)) should generally not be used, and instead each field
of x should be compared individually as in x.f1==old(x.f1) & x.f2==old(x.f2). In this
paper, we first describe this lack of encapsulation and other problems of old expressions
in more detail. Then, to address those problems, we propose our novel past expression
along with its formal semantics. We also describe how our past expression can be supported
during runtime assertion checking. We explain the involved problems, and show how
we solve them. We implement our solution by means of AOP where we exploit various
primitive pointcuts including our custom branch pointcut.},

abstract = {Software errors often originate from incorrect changes, including incorrect program
fixes, incorrect feature updates, and so on. Capturing the intended program behavior
explicitly via contracts is thus an attractive proposition. In our recent work, we
had espoused the notion of “change contracts” to express the intended program behavior
changes across program versions. Change contracts differ from program contracts in
that they do not require the programmer to describe the intended behavior of those
program features which are unchanged across program versions. In this work, we present
the formal semantics of our change contract language built on top of the Java modeling
language (JML). Our change contract language can describe behavioral as well as structural
changes. We evaluate the expressivity of the change contract language via a survey
given to final-year undergraduate students. The survey results enable to understand
the usability of our change contract language for purposes of writing contracts, comprehending
written contracts, and modifying programs according to given change contracts.Finally,
we develop both dynamic and static checkers for change contracts, and show how they
can be used in maintaining software changes. We use our dynamic checker to automatically
suggest tests that manifest violations of change contracts. Meanwhile, we use our
static checker to verify that a program is changed as specified in its change contract.
Apart from verification, our static checker also performs various other software engineering
tasks, such as localizing the buggy method, detecting/debugging regression errors,
and classifying the cause for a test failure as either error in production code or
error in test code.},

abstract = {Program repair techniques attempt to fix programs by looking for patches within a search space of fix candidates. These techniques require a specification of the program to be repaired, used as an acceptance criterion for fix candidates, that often also plays an important role in guiding some search processes. Most tools use tests as specifications, which constitutes a risk, since the incompleteness of tests as specifications may lead one to obtain spurious repairs, that pass all tests but are in fact incorrect. This problem has been identified by various researchers, raising concerns about the validity of program fixes. More thorough studies have been proposed using different sets of tests for fix validation, and resorting to manual inspection, showing that while tools reduce their program fixing rate, they are still able to repair a significant number of cases.In this paper, we perform a different analysis of the suitability of tests as acceptance criteria for automated program fixes, by checking patches produced by automated repair tools using a bug-finding tool, as opposed to previous works that used tests or manual inspections. We develop a number of experiments in which faulty programs from a known benchmark are fed to the program repair tools GenProg, Angelix, AutoFix and Nopol, using test suites of varying quality and extension, including those accompanying the benchmark. We then check the produced patches against formal specifications using a bug-finding tool. Our results show that, in general, automated program repair tools are significantly more likely to accept a spurious program fix than producing an actual one, in the studied scenarios.},
